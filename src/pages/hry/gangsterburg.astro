      <h2>More about the game</h2>
        <p>
        The city of Gangsterburg was always the home of myriads of criminals and outcasts. Newly elected City Council knows the final solution! General amnesty and privatization of all city enterprises brings challenges for all mafia mob bosses to exploit the prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a head of one of the families your task is to get more influence than any others and take control of the whole Gangsterburg!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can buy the degustation companies (pubs), financial advisories (casinos), public services (brothels) and centres of experience (illegal drugs) and corrupt the police, judges and politicians.
        </p>
